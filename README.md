# ELEC3720
Implements a MIPS instruction set architecture of a single cycle processor with 18 bit wide instructions and a data-word width of 32 bits. The processor has a 5 stage pipeline structure including Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write Back. 

It uses SystemVerilog, has been tested on a DE2 board and uses a python assembler translates the assembly language code into binary machine language code.
